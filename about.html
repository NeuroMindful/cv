  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img src="images/Head Shot jpeg-modified.png" alt="Jeremy'c profile picture">
  <p>My background is in Cell/Molecular Biology along with PhD in Neuroscience (emphasizing Cognitive Neuroscience) affords me expertise spanning molecular, pharmacological, anatomical, behavioral, and complex system dynamics of human phenomena. My graduate work focused on studying brain anatomy related to persistent developmental stuttering. From there my research interests branched into emotional processing and the neural systems that underlie our emotional experiences. With a particular interest in understanding how changes in the brain relate to emotional dysregulation, I moved to a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University in the Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research within the Psychiatry Department at the Stanford School of Medicine. There my research focused on brain structure and function that relates to anxiety, depression, and psychosis, primarily in developmental populations. My work continued concerning structural and functional brain networks related to emotion and autonomic function, ultimately leading to greater focus on attentional systems, self-awareness and resiliency through mindfulness and meditation. Along the way, I gained additional expertise in cognitive and emotional developmental processes, attachment theory, learning theory, and complex models of trauma in the brain as well as throughout the nervous system.</p>
  <p>My exploration of Buddhist perspectives began as an undergraduate during a Philosophy of Self course in 2000, where I first encountered the concept of Anatta or "No-Self." Intrigued by its implications, I dove deeper into the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh and reprints of Buddhist scriptures, called Sutas. My early meditation experience was self-taught, explored through written instructions from Thich Nhat Hanh, and simply meditating on my own. My practice deepened with directed work in Metta (or Loving-Kindness) Meditation. In 2007, I began more traditional Anapana, or breath-focused meditation work after joining the <a href="https://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/">Insight Meditation Center</a> of Redwood City, CA led by Gil Fronsdal. Coming full circle, I reinvigorated my daily practice in 2016 by joining The Mindfulness Community of Greater New Orleans Sangha associated with the <a href="https://plumvillage.org/community/order-of-interbeing/">Order of Interbeing</a> led by Thich Nhat Hanh. I took my first 3-day silent retreat over my birthday weekend of 2018, a gift that keeps giving. Not only did I learn powerful personal lessons, the experience also taught me very clearly my deep intention to devote as much energy as possible to helping to teach and guide others in their meditation practice. I subequently completed three online retreats with <a href="https://www.davidchernikoff.com/">David Chernikoff</a> in 2020, which offered grounding in Vipassana, or Insight, Meditation. I was particularly drawn to the non-verbal aspect of this practice and continued on this path with 10-day silent <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/">S.N. Goenka retreats</a> in 2021 and 2022. My goal is to use modern Neuroscience to demystify meditation practice and help guide practitioners of every level to continue on the path to retrain the brain and mind and cultivate awareness, equanimity and compassion.</p>
